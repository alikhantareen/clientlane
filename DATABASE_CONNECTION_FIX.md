# Database Connection Pooling Fix

## Problem
The application was experiencing "Too many database connections" errors (P2037) when navigating between dashboard pages, especially the freelancer dashboard. This was caused by:

1. **Inefficient query patterns**: The freelancer dashboard was making 24 separate database queries in a loop (12 months × 2 queries each)
2. **No connection pooling management**: Prisma client wasn't configured with proper connection pooling settings
3. **No error handling**: Connection pool exhaustion wasn't handled gracefully

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Optimized Prisma Client Configuration (`lib/prisma.ts`)
- Added proper connection management with error handling
- Implemented graceful shutdown on process exit
- Added production-specific logging configuration

### 2. Database Utilities (`lib/utils/database.ts`)
- `withDatabaseOperation()`: Wraps database operations with error handling and connection retry logic
- `optimizedDatabaseQuery()`: Executes queries with timeout and retry mechanisms
- `executeBatchedQueries()`: Processes multiple queries in batches to prevent connection exhaustion
- `checkDatabaseHealth()`: Monitors database connection health
- `getConnectionMetrics()`: Provides connection performance metrics

### 3. Optimized Freelancer Dashboard API (`app/api/dashboard/freelancer/route.ts`)
- **Batched monthly queries**: Replaced 24 individual queries with a single transaction containing all monthly data queries
- **Connection management**: Wrapped all database operations with error handling utilities
- **Fallback values**: Added fallback values for all database operations to prevent crashes
- **Timeout handling**: Added 45-second timeout for complex queries with retry logic

### 4. Enhanced Database Configuration (`lib/config/database.ts`)
- Environment-specific connection pool settings
- Production: 1-20 connections, Development: 2-10 connections
- Proper timeout and retry configurations

### 5. Health Monitoring (`app/api/health/database/route.ts`)
- New endpoint to monitor database connection health
- Provides connection metrics and status information

### 6. Next.js Optimizations (`next.config.ts`)
- Added server components external packages optimization
- Production-specific performance settings
- API route caching headers

## Key Changes Made

### Before (Problematic Code):
```typescript
// 24 separate database queries in a loop
for (let i = 11; i >= 0; i--) {
  const [updatesCount, clientsCount] = await Promise.all([
    prisma.update.count({...}),
    prisma.portal.count({...})
  ]);
}
```

### After (Optimized Code):
```typescript
// Single transaction with all queries batched
const monthlyData = await optimizedDatabaseQuery(async () => {
  return await prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {
    // All 24 queries executed in a single transaction
    for (const range of monthRanges) {
      const [updatesCount, clientsCount] = await Promise.all([
        tx.update.count({...}),
        tx.portal.count({...})
      ]);
    }
  });
}, { timeout: 45000, retries: 2, fallback: [] });
```

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Deploy the changes** to your Vercel environment
2. **Monitor the health endpoint**: Check `/api/health/database` to verify connection status
3. **Test navigation**: Try navigating between dashboard pages rapidly to ensure no connection errors
4. **Monitor logs**: Watch Vercel function logs for any remaining connection issues

## Environment Variables

Ensure your production environment has:
- `DATABASE_URL`: Your database connection string
- `NODE_ENV`: Set to "production"

## Monitoring

After deployment, monitor:
1. **Database health**: `/api/health/database`
2. **Vercel function logs**: Check for connection pool errors
3. **User reports**: Monitor for any remaining dashboard navigation issues

## Expected Results

- ✅ No more "Too many connections" errors
- ✅ Faster dashboard loading times
- ✅ Better error handling and graceful degradation
- ✅ Improved connection pool management
- ✅ Health monitoring capabilities

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:
1. Check the health endpoint for connection status
2. Review Vercel function logs for error patterns
3. Consider increasing connection pool limits if needed
4. Monitor database server connection limits
